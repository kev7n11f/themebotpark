# Security Policy for ThemeBotPark

## Overview

ThemeBotPark is committed to ensuring the security and privacy of its users and their data. This document outlines the application's security controls, user validation scenarios, and the process for reporting and handling vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. User Validation Scenarios

1. **Registration Flow**
   - Email validation with format checking and verification email (pending implementation).
   - Password strength enforced (minimum length, character variety).
   - Duplicate email checking to prevent account enumeration.
2. **Login Flow**
   - Credential verification using bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds).
   - JWT issuance upon successful login.
   - Rate limiting and lockout after repeated failed attempts.
3. **Password Reset Flow**
   - Password reset link sent via email (with expiration).
   - Token-based validation to prevent replay attacks.
   - Passwords never sent or stored in plain text.

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**
  - Stored in localStorage (short-lived tokens, refresh as needed).
  - Server-side verification for all protected endpoints.
  - Token invalidation on logout or password change.

- **Role-Based Access Control**
  - Admin and creator routes protected via middleware.
  - User roles stored in JWT and verified server-side.

---

## 3. API Security

- **Rate Limiting**
  - All API endpoints protected by rate limiters to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **CORS Policy**
  - Only requests from whitelisted origins (production and staging domains) are allowed.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  - All inputs validated and sanitized server-side to prevent injection attacks.
- **HTTPS Enforcement**
  - All production traffic served over HTTPS (enforced in Vercel config).

---

## 4. Data Protection

- **Password Storage**
  - All passwords hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds).
- **Sensitive Data**
  - Environment variables and API keys never exposed to the client.
  - Stripe and OpenAI API keys stored server-side only.
- **Database Security**
  - Principle of least privilege for database connections.
  - Regular backups and encrypted storage (if applicable).

---

## 5. Dependencies & CI/CD

- **Dependency Management**
  - Automatic vulnerability scanning via `npm audit` and GitHub Dependabot.
  - Critical security updates patched as soon as possible.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - All code changes require PR reviews.
  - Linting and basic security checks run on every push via GitHub Actions.
